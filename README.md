# Jacob's Convolutional Neural Network (JCNN) 
This repository is an exploration into how to build convolutional neural networks from the ground up. It is written in 
Python3.7 using only NumPy and Flask.

To create a virtual environment for project dependencies:
```python
mkdir venv
python3 -m venv venv
```

Install all requirements:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# To run the demo
Start the debug server:
```python
python3 run.py
```
Then open index.html in your browser.

# Train a model on mnist
```python
python3 server/model/alpha_model.py
```
